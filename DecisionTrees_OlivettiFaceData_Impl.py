# Decision Tree
# Download the Olivetti faces dataset. 
# Visit https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/olivetti_faces.html
# There are 40 classes (corresponding to 40 people), each class having 10 faces of the individual; so there are a total of 400 images. 
# Here each face is viewed as an imgae of size 64 Ã— 64 (= 4096) pixels; each pixel having values 0 to 255 which are ultimately converted into floating numbers in the range [0,1]. 
# 
# Split the dataset into train
# and test parts. Do this splitting randomly 10 times and report the average accuracy.
# You may vary the test and train dataset sizes.
# 
# Build a decision tree using the training data. Tune the parameters
# corresponding to pruning the decision tree. Use the best decision tree to classify
# the test dataset and obtain the accuracy. Use misclassification impurity also.
