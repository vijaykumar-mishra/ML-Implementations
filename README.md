Machine Learning Practice Problems
==================================
This repository contains a collection of machine learning practice problems with hands-on implementation of various algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNNC), Classification, and Clustering. These projects are designed for educational purposes, allowing users to understand and practice fundamental machine learning techniques.

Introduction
==================================
This repository focuses on demonstrating and practicing key machine learning concepts with Python implementations. It includes different techniques such as classification and clustering, along with real-world datasets for better understanding. Each technique is implemented from scratch or using libraries such as Scikit-learn and is well-documented with code comments and explanations.

Algorithms Implemented
==================================
K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNNC)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and effective algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, I demonstrate how KNN works and how to tune hyperparameters like k to achieve optimal performance on classification datasets.

Key Features:
==================================
KNN-based classification.
Hyperparameter tuning for the number of neighbors (k).
Distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan).
Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
Classification
This section covers various classification algorithms to help identify classes of data points. I include implementations of popular classification algorithms, each explained with code, comments, and results.

Algorithms Covered:
==================================
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Clustering
Clustering involves grouping data points into distinct clusters based on their features. This section demonstrates the use of clustering algorithms to identify natural groupings in datasets.

Clustering Algorithms:
==================================
K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
DBSCAN
