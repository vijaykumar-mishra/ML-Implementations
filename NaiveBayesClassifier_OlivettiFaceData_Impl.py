# Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier (NBC)
# Download the Olivetti faces dataset. 
# Visit https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/olivetti_faces.html
# There are 40 classes (corresponding to 40 people), each class having 10 faces of the individual; so there are a total of 400 images. 
# Here each face is viewed as an imgae of size 64 Ã— 64 (= 4096) pixels; each pixel having values 0 to 255 which are ultimately converted into floating numbers in the range [0,1]. 
# Split the dataset into train and test parts such that there are 320 images, 8 images per person (8 X 40 ) for training and 80 images, 2 images per person, (2 X 40) for testing.
# Repeat the experiment using 10 diferent random splits having 320 training faces and 80 test faces as specified above and report the average accuracy
# Use the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier (NBC) to classify the test data and report the results
